### GraphQL

This is one of my school projects (Zone01 Rouen Normandie), GraphQL. This web app requests data from my school's GraphQL API and displays it to the user. **Note that the application only works if you are a Zone01 student, as you need an account to access the data.**

## How to Run

To run the app, execute the following commands in the terminal:

    npm install (Install all dependencies)
    npm start
    open your browser at http://localhost:3000
